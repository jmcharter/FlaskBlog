---
The following user stories will be true:

* As a store owner, I want to keep track of all donuts given away and tie them to some for of ID, for example a Police Badge number or a 'Donut Card' ID.

* As a store owner, I want to make sure that an individual only takes a maximum of one donut per day. If they come back for more then a warning should let me or an employee know. This should be based on the given ID number.

* As a store owner, I want the option to override the warning so that I can give additional donuts under exceptional circumstances. This should also be tracked.

* As a store owner, at any time I should be able to enter an ID to see a person's donut record.
